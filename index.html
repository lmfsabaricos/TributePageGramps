<p class="bio">
To many, he wasn‚Äôt just a public servant.
He was a friend, a mentor, and a father figure to so many.
He stood for strength, humility, and kindness.

In San Jose Occidental Mindoro, he gave over two decades of his life to serving the people,
always showing up and always uplifting the lives of those around him.

He didn‚Äôt just lead, he cared ‚Äî and that made all the difference.
</p>
<p class="bio">
He didn't need to say much because his presence said it all. He was known for his warm
smile and open heart. Muloy lead with his heart, he gave people hope, not just through promises,
but by following through on them. That's what made his leadership unforgettable and how he earned the love
and respect of his community.</p>

<p class="bio">
He led with compassion, served with integrity, and inspired others through his actions. He doesn't need
to ask for recognition‚Äî his actions, achievements, and the respect of others spoke for him.

His legacy lives on through the countless lives he touched and the values he stood for:
service, unity, and genuine care for the people.</p>
